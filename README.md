# Hello guys! This is my first ReactJS project.

Here I have made a form that takes username, emails, password as input.

## Username

It should not be blank, or else it will give an error message.

## Email

Same as username, but email should be in abc@xyz.com format.

## Password 

Same with at least six characters required to create the password.

## Register

When you click the Register button, you will be given a greeting with your username.

That's it. It was fun making it.
